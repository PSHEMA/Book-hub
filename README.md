   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a database named `bookhub`.
   - Run the following SQL query to create the `books` table:

         title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         genre VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
         publicationDate DATE NOT NULL,
         rating FLOAT
     );
     ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=bookhub
   PORT=5000
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder and add the following environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
